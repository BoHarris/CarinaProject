CarinaProject - Testing Framework Utilization
This repository demonstrates my work with the Carina testing framework, structured to showcase robust API and web testing functionalities. The project includes organized directories for API and web tests, alongside well-defined models, utilities, and configuration files.

API Tests: Contains various tests (API SampleTest*) covering common CRUD operations and data models (e.g., Album, Comment, User), illustrating Carina’s API testing capabilities.
Web Tests: Implements Carina’s page object model in FacebookLoginTest and GSMArenaTest, designed for web applications with modular components for error handling and user actions.
Resources & Configurations: Structured resources such as log4j2.xml for logging and crypto.key for secure data handling, along with XML mappers (UserMapper.xml, UserPreferenceMapper.xml) for database interactions.
Framework Setup: Essential configurations are initialized to support testing consistency and scalability, following best practices in test automation with Carina.
This project serves as an example of structured testing with Carina, focusing on maintainable and scalable test design principles.
